I'll blog about whatever I find interesting here. 

I am primarily interested in science, music, and nature but I also have interests in sports, finance, and entrepreneurship. I'd like to start a podcast soon, being inspired by folks like [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/) and [Joe Rogan](https://www.joerogan.com/). If you need any small web development work, check out my [click here][portfolio] and reach out.
