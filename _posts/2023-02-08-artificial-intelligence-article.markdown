One of my favorite things about computer science is that it is one of the simplest and most complicated fields to enter. Anyone can learn to program if they have patience. It genuinely requires patience more than intelligence; it feels like 99% of writing any piece of software is overcoming failures, persevering through maddening errors, and debugging code for hours on end.

# artificial intelligence is a buzzword
One of the most *socially* popular sub fields of computer science is artificial intelligence (AI). I see a lot of news headlines throwing this word around vaguely,  This can be really confusing, but the term “AI” is a buzzword for something called machine learning (**ML**) which is a field that encompasses things like neural networks (NN for short, these include convolutional and artificial networks denoted as CNNs and ANNs respectively), deep learning (DL), support vector machines (SVMs) and more things I am probably not mentioning here. *please comment about it if you would like*. These things I mentioned all utilize a lot of complicated mathematical concepts like linear algebra, Fourier transforms, activation functions, and complicated ass algorithms that smart people made to carry out some task like identifying a dog amongst a data set of 10,000 labeled images of dog breeds. Labeled here simply means the photo in the data set has an associated label that describes the photo.
